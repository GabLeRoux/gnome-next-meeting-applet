## Features

* Make it easy to know how long you have until your next meeting.
* Detect video conference URL in location or google meet.
* Shows the documents link to the current meeting.
* Fully configurable.

## Configuration

### Applet configuration

The applet can be configured with a config.yaml yaml located in your
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gnome-next-meeting-applet/config.yaml`. It gets created
automatically with default value at startup if you don't have one already.

A configured example is located in the [config.sample.yaml](./config.samples.yaml).

* **default_icon**: The default icon when showing each meeting.
* **event_organizers_icon**: A map between a regexp matching the organizer to an
  icon. This allows you to easily differentiate certain type of meetings like
  the one from your team or colleagues.
* **max_results**: Max results to ask to google calendar api.
* **skip_non_accepted**: Skip the calendar events that you didn't accept, you
  need to configure `my_email` setting for that.
* **my_emails**: A list of email addresses.
* **restrict_to_calendar**: Restrict to some calendar, by default it shows event from all calendars.
* **title_max_char**: The maximum length of the title
* **change_icon_minutes**: Before the meeting x minutes before the event we will
  change the icon to gently remind you to connect.


### Calendars

All calendars are configured directly in Gnome Online Account setting, it will
grab the events from there. Here is some instructions on how to setup your
online calendars in Gnome :

https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/accounts.html.en

### Starting

You can just do :

Alt+F2 and start `gnome-next-meeting-applet`.

(I will be happy to add a `.desktop` file for launching
gnome-next-meeting-applet directly but would need an icon first, if you have one
let me know and I'll add this üßù)

There is a setting menu in the applet to add an autostart file to autostart it
when gnome launch.
